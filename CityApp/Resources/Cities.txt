"Tokyo","Japan","http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/9b/2e/18/tokyo.jpg","Tradition collides with pop culture in Tokyo, where you can reverently wander ancient temples before rocking out at a karaoke bar. Wake up before the sun to catch the lively fish auction at the Tsukiji Market, then refresh with a walk beneath the cherry blossom trees that line the Sumida River."
"Sydney","Australia","http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/9b/2e/15/sydney.jpg","Sydney offers plenty of historical and contemporary Australian flavor. The marvelous Sydney Opera House looks like a great origami sailboat, floating peacefully in a harbor. Wander the narrow cobblestone streets of The Rocks and then take in a street performance on the Circular Quay before heading into the Museum of Contemporary Art."
"Los Angeles","United States","http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/c4/ea/60/hiking-the-hollywood.jpg","Hollywood beckons to tourists who long for a brush with Tinseltown glamor. Tour movie studios, slip your hands into the famous prints at the TCL Chinese Theatre, or indulge in a celeb sighting at one of LAâ€™s white-hot nightspots. Spot your favorite star while shopping at The Grove, or forget all about the famous eye candy as you take in the iconic artwork at The Getty."
